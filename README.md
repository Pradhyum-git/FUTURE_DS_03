# Student Feedback Analysis

## Project Overview
The Student Feedback Analysis project aims to analyze and extract insights from student feedback data to evaluate the effectiveness of teaching methods, course content, and overall student satisfaction. This analysis helps educators identify strengths and areas for improvement in academic programs.

## Dataset
**Source:** Kaggle

### Features
- **Student ID:** Unique Id assigned to each student.
- **Well versed with the subject:** Rating of the subject knowledge.
- **Explain concepts in an understandable way:** Rating based on how well the teacher explained concepts.
- **Use of presentations:** Rating of usage of presentations in classes.
